    <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p id="paragraph1">Throughout my post college career, I have struggled to find a path that I found interesting and helpful. After spending several years searching for a good fit, I have come to believe that becoming an Instructional Designer meets all of my criteria. I have a strong desire to learn more about the way that education is changing, and want to know how I can influence and help implement those changes. I come from a family of teachers and I feel that my interests in education and graphic design, combined with my desire to help others, will lead to a successful career as an Instructional Designer.</p><br>
<p class="paragraph2">I hope to learn many things throughout this <strong>MS in Learning Technologies and Design</strong> program. When I take IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services, I am excited to learn about usability testing and creating systems with users in mind. This course is required for the UXU certificate. I am looking forward to analyzing the results of research such as surveys that we create. I hope to find ways to improve systems using the research results so that users can access information easier. I like to go into rabbit holes and research different topics (I am the genealogist for my family), so I am looking forward to going down the research rabbit hole for improving learning systems. I think the UXU aspect will be interesting as it is such an important topic for any web-based site.</p><br>

    <p class="paragraph2">My educational background is in archives. Learning systems are essentially archives of information about a topic that is being taught. During IS_LT 9474: Front End Analysis of Systems, with my archival background, I am interested in finding ways to improve those retrieval methods and user interaction with the system. How can we make learning systems more accessible, user friendly, and time efficient for the average person so that they can have equal access to knowledge? I am excited about working with real world systems so that we can, at least in our project, make them better. I want to learn about different methods of data collection and how to conduct data collection. I am looking forward to working with different groups to acquire that information.</p><br>

        <p class="paragraph2">Finally, I am excited about the ISLT_9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies. In undergrad, I completed two internships at museums. Those were both in person and I learned a lot because I got to work in a real world setting with real patrons. I am not sure if my internship for 9480 will be remote or in person, but either way, I am excited to work in a new field. I hope to complete the internship in a healthcare setting, since I would like to work in a healthcare-centered company or hospital. I am looking forward to using the IE lab and meeting other students in the program! This course was the reason that I wanted to pursue the UXU certificate and look forward to earning the certificate.</p>
