    <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p id="paragraph1">Throughout my post college career, I have struggled to find a path that I found interesting and helpful. After spending several years searching for a good fit, I have come to believe that becoming an Instructional Designer meets all of my criteria. I have a strong desire to learn more about the way that education is changing, and want to know how I can influence and help implement those changes. I come from a family of teachers and I feel that my interests in education and graphic design, combined with my desire to help others, will lead to a successful career as an Instructional Designer or Trainer/Staff Developer.</p><br>

<p class="paragraph2">I learned many things during my <strong>MS in Learning Technologies and Design</strong> program. During my program, I felt that I got the most out of my research course, project management course, and courses for the Usability and User Experience (UXU) certificate. When taking 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services, I learned about usability testing and creating systems with users in mind. This course was required for the UXU certificate. I enjoyed working with my team, getting to learn how to work on a team in a context such as usability testing, and how to conduct and report usability testing. Our group selected the website goodreads to conduct our usability study on. I often referred back to my notes from this course in other courses I took for the UXU and MS programs.</p><br>

    	<p class="paragraph2">I have already used much of what I have learned in a professional context. I applied my formative and summative evaluation knowledge to my job working with medical students, and I was able to network through my internship. I hope to become a trainer, staff development specialist, or instructional designer. I would like to work in a government or healthcare capacity, as I enjoy those fields and think the knowledge I gained in my MS and UXU programs will lend nicely to those jobs. </p>
