    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services</h4>
        <p id="paragraph1">This course is an introduction to “concepts and methods of usability testing and research and user-centered design strategy”. This course will be taken as part of the Grad Certificate in User Experience and Usability. My goal with this course is to learn how to perform studies that research how to improve the usability of websites and applications. I also hope to learn how to implement those changes based on results and findings of the research that will be performed in the class. This will be vital knowledge for my career as an instructional designer. If you do not know what the problems are with a learning tool, then you cannot improve it.

            <br><p>A weakness for me will be group work - I often take a passive role in group settings. This can lead to me not exploring my ideas as thoroughly as I would if I worked alone. A strength for me in this course will be that I am creative when it comes to finding solutions to problems.

    <h4>IS_LT 9474: Front End Analysis of Systems</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> This course will provide the knowledge to “develop skills for systematically analyzing learning systems that need to be improved”. ISLT_9474 is a course that counts towards the Grad Certificate in User Experience and Usability. With this course, I hope to learn about data collection by way of conducting interviews or surveys, and how to develop those tools from scratch. I’m looking forward to learning the skill of data interpretation. I’m excited about applying the skills learned in this class to real world systems. There are so many websites and systems that could be improved based on user feedback - and I am excited at the idea of learning about the ways those changes can be made and implemented. 
    <br><p>I feel that a weakness for me in this course will be working with the data and actually putting the information together. A strength will be creating the surveys used to collect the data. I love asking questions, finding things to improve, and compiling lists. I want to know how to make learning systems more user friendly so that more people can access the information within them. I see the internet and learning systems like one big library - I want to help make that information easier to obtain. Materials I would use would be excel or google spreadsheets to organize the data, and a program, such as Google forms, to administer the surveys.

<h4>IS_LT 9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> This internship is required for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. This internship is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue the UXU certificate. The internship will provide real world experience working in ID that I want to have by the time I graduate. I completed my internship with Missouri Online. Missouri Online works with diverse clientele with unique needs. 

    <br><p> I completed my internship with Missouri Online during the Fall 2024 semester. My advisor was Dr. Joi Moore. I conducted a usability test on the Design Sprint courses that are created by Missouri Online for faculty at the University of Missouri.

    <h4> Learning Technologies Program Goals and Objectives</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> 


<p id="paragraph1">The LTD program prepares students to systematically design, develop, evaluate and lead learning technology and instructional solutions within schools, universities, corporations, and public and private organizations.

<p> Goal 1: Students will develop theory and research-based skills for innovative, aesthetic, accessible, equitable, effective and sustainable design and development of technologies for learning opportunities and systems. 
      <p> Objective 1.1: Students will design and develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, student-centered learning, collaborative work, and performance support.
        <br> Objective 1.2: Students will design and develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. 
       <br>Objective 1.3: Students can conduct project management activities to support the total lifecycle of design, development and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.
      <br>Objective 1.4: Students will demonstrate mastery of technological production skills in web development, digital asset creation, and other applicable development skills necessary for the creation of learning systems, (e.g. web page prototyping, game design, digital media, etc.).
    <p><br>Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
        <br>Objective 2.1: Students can choose and conduct appropriate analytical methods and apply the results to the systematic design and development of learning environments and systems. 
        <br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).</p>
    <p><br>Goal 3: Students will understand the impact of technologies we create or use on society at large and strive to produce ethical, inclusive, and equitable instructional systems and technologies. 
       <br> Objective 3.1: Student will demonstrate ethical and inclusive practices to all aspects of analytical data collection and analysis methods used in the design and evaluation of instructional products or learning environments. (e.g., sampling methods) 
       <br> Objective 3.2: Students will design and implement instructional products and learning environments based upon Universal Design Principles.</p>
