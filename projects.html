    <h4>IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services</h4>
        <p id="paragraph1"> Course Description: Introduction to concepts and methods of usability testing and research and user-centered design strategy. Course takes a process approach to define target audiences and usability problems, create and administer investigative procedures, analyze results, and report findings effectively. Graded on A-F basis only.
    <br>This course was taught under Dr. Noah Glaser and covered topics such as heuristic evaluations, accessiblity, and usability as a concept and in practice.

    <h4>IS_LT 9471: Instructional Systems Design</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> Course Description: Develop knowledge and skills related to the systematic design of instruction. Learn to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate learning systems and instruction.  Identify appropriate technologies to support learning and explore alternative models of instructional design.
    <br> This course was taught under Dr. Heather Tillberg-Webb. This course covered topics such as the ADDIE model in adult learning, needs analysis, and project framing. The course culminated in a group project to redesign and improve a learning management system. My group selected Canvas.

<h4>IS_LT 9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> This internship is required for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. This internship is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue the UXU certificate. The internship provided real world experience working in UX and usability testing. I completed my internship with Missouri Online. Missouri Online works with diverse clientele with unique needs to meet educational demands within the University of Missouri system. 

    <br><p> I completed my internship with Missouri Online during the Fall 2024 semester. My advisor was Dr. Joi Moore and my client was Missouri Online and Brad Mitchell. I conducted a usability test on the Design Sprint courses that are created by Missouri Online for faculty at the University of Missouri. The internship culminated in a usability study report and presentation.

    <h4> Learning Technologies Program Goals and Objectives</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> 


<p id="paragraph1">The LTD program prepares students to systematically design, develop, evaluate and lead learning technology and instructional solutions within schools, universities, corporations, and public and private organizations.

<p> Goal 1: Students will develop theory and research-based skills for innovative, aesthetic, accessible, equitable, effective and sustainable design and development of technologies for learning opportunities and systems. 
      <p> Objective 1.1: Students will design and develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, student-centered learning, collaborative work, and performance support.
        <br> Objective 1.2: Students will design and develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. 
       <br>Objective 1.3: Students can conduct project management activities to support the total lifecycle of design, development and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.
      <br>Objective 1.4: Students will demonstrate mastery of technological production skills in web development, digital asset creation, and other applicable development skills necessary for the creation of learning systems, (e.g. web page prototyping, game design, digital media, etc.).
    <p><br>Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
        <br>Objective 2.1: Students can choose and conduct appropriate analytical methods and apply the results to the systematic design and development of learning environments and systems. 
        <br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).</p>
    <p><br>Goal 3: Students will understand the impact of technologies we create or use on society at large and strive to produce ethical, inclusive, and equitable instructional systems and technologies. 
       <br> Objective 3.1: Student will demonstrate ethical and inclusive practices to all aspects of analytical data collection and analysis methods used in the design and evaluation of instructional products or learning environments. (e.g., sampling methods) 
       <br> Objective 3.2: Students will design and implement instructional products and learning environments based upon Universal Design Principles.</p>
