    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <h4>IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services</h4>
        <p id="paragraph1">This course is an introduction to “concepts and methods of usability testing and research and user-centered design strategy”. This course will be taken as part of the Grad Certificate in User Experience and Usability. My goal with this course is to learn how to perform studies that research how to improve the usability of websites and applications. I also hope to learn how to implement those changes based on results and findings of the research that will be performed in the class. This will be vital knowledge for my career as an instructional designer. If you do not know what the problems are with a learning tool, then you cannot improve it.

            </br><p>A weakness for me will be group work - I often take a passive role in group settings. This can lead to me not exploring my ideas as thoroughly as I would if I worked alone. A strength for me in this course will be that I am creative when it comes to finding solutions to problems.

    <h4>IS_LT 9474: Front End Analysis of Systems</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> This course will provide the knowledge to “develop skills for systematically analyzing learning systems that need to be improved”. ISLT_9474 is a course that counts towards the Grad Certificate in User Experience and Usability. With this course, I hope to learn about data collection by way of conducting interviews or surveys, and how to develop those tools from scratch. I’m looking forward to learning the skill of data interpretation. I’m excited about applying the skills learned in this class to real world systems. There are so many websites and systems that could be improved based on user feedback - and I am excited at the idea of learning about the ways those changes can be made and implemented. 
    </br><p>I feel that a weakness for me in this course will be working with the data and actually putting the information together. A strength will be creating the surveys used to collect the data. I love asking questions, finding things to improve, and compiling lists. I want to know how to make learning systems more user friendly so that more people can access the information within them. I see the internet and learning systems like one big library - I want to help make that information easier to obtain. Materials I would use would be excel or google spreadsheets to organize the data, and a program, such as Google forms, to administer the surveys.

<h4>IS_LT 9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> This class is required for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. This internship is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue the UXU certificate. The internship will provide real world experience working in ID that I want to have by the time I graduate. I hope to either work with an office in the University of Missouri - possibly in the School of Medicine or MU Health Care. These entities work with diverse clientele with unique needs. I want to create projects that can be used in my portfolio that have also been used for real world applications. Access to the Information Experience Laboratory (IE Lab) was also another major reason I chose to pursue this certificate. I’m a local distance student, and having the ability to visit the lab in person will help me meet and make connections with others involved in Instructional Design. 

    </br><p>A weakness for this internship will be time constraints as I work full time. However, I have the drive to work hard and succeed to get the most out of the internship. As I work full-time during the day, I would most likely need to complete the internship remotely. I would use my laptop to access zoom for meetings and programs such as Microsoft applications and any tools recommended or provided to me by the internship.
