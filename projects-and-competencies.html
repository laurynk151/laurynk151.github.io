    <h4> Learning Technologies Program Goals and Objectives</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> 


<p id="paragraph1">The LTD program prepares students to systematically design, develop, evaluate and lead learning technology and instructional solutions within schools, universities, corporations, and public and private organizations.

<p id="paragraph1">Goal 1: Students will develop theory and research-based skills for innovative, aesthetic, accessible, equitable, effective and sustainable design and development of technologies for learning opportunities and systems. 
      <p> Objective 1.1: Students will design and develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, student-centered learning, collaborative work, and performance support.
        <br> Objective 1.2: Students will design and develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. 
       <br>Objective 1.3: Students can conduct project management activities to support the total lifecycle of design, development and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.
      <br>Objective 1.4: Students will demonstrate mastery of technological production skills in web development, digital asset creation, and other applicable development skills necessary for the creation of learning systems, (e.g. web page prototyping, game design, digital media, etc.).
   
<br><p id="paragraph1"><Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
        <br>Objective 2.1: Students can choose and conduct appropriate analytical methods and apply the results to the systematic design and development of learning environments and systems. 
        <br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).</p>
 
<br><p id="paragraph1">Goal 3: Students will understand the impact of technologies we create or use on society at large and strive to produce ethical, inclusive, and equitable instructional systems and technologies. 
       <br> Objective 3.1: Student will demonstrate ethical and inclusive practices to all aspects of analytical data collection and analysis methods used in the design and evaluation of instructional products or learning environments. (e.g., sampling methods) 
       <br> Objective 3.2: Students will design and implement instructional products and learning environments based upon Universal Design Principles.</p>

          <p>This portfolio website was built during the course IS_LT 7355. Using the instruction of Dr. Noah Glaser (Summer 2023 semester), I had no prior background knowledge of HTML (aside from minor coding a decade ago to update webpages on a blog site). I have continued to build on to this portfolio, and have updated it to include PDFs from various projects, among other elements.  </p>

        	<p> <p id="paragraph1"> IS_LT 9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies
<br> Provides internship experience under supervision in advanced levels of practical experience in Information Science and Learning Technology Research and Teaching. </p><br>

<p><br>I completed this internship as part of the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. or this internship, I worked with the Design Services team in eLearning with Missouri Online. My advisor for the project was Dr. Joi Moore. I worked with Brad Mitchell, who is the Experience Design Manager for Missouri Online's Design Services team. The internship was completed during the Fall 2024 semester. With Brad, I helped to conduct usabiity testing regarding the Design Sprint micro-courses. This testing was completed by me, not in a group setting (Brad acted as Instructional Designer and interviewing participants). Missouri Online is an online system that administers various online courses and programs to the four universities within the UM System. The services provided by Missouri Online allow for educational access to many students in Missouri and across the country. Missouri Online offers various services, including quality course reviews, training and certification, and design reviews. Among these services offered are various micro-courses that are known as Course Sprints. One type of Course Sprint is a Design Sprint. These Design Sprints introduce elements of visual design and online course building to faculty of any background, so long as they are in the UM system.

    <h4> IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services </h4>
<p id="paragraph1"> Course Description: Introduction to concepts and methods of usability testing and research and user-centered design strategy. Course takes a process approach to define target audiences and usability problems, create and administer investigative procedures, analyze results, and report findings effectively. 
            <p id="paragraph1"> Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
      <p><br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).
          <p><br>In ISLT 9421, we completed a series of group projects and usability tests. Under the instruction of Dr. Noah Glaser (Spring 2024 semester), I learned about various elements of usablity and usability testing. These included: usability evaluation methods, usability heuristics and evaluations, and mental models. During the semester, my group completed various projects and reports together. For the final project, our group completed a usability study evaluating the website Goodreads.com. I contributed to the usability testing, describing the technology/tool and its purpose, and the instruments for data collection and analysis section on the final report. In the report, we make reccomendations for improvement to the goodreads site based on user feedback from the usability tests.</p>

             <h4><strong>IS_LT 9471: Instructional Systems Design</strong></h4>

           <p id="paragraph1">Course Description: Develop knowledge and skills related to the systematic design of instruction. Learn to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate learning systems and instruction.  Identify appropriate technologies to support learning and explore alternative models of instructional design.<p></br>
           <p class="paragraph2"> This course required a semester long group project as the final assignment. Our project foucsed on improving canvas for student in the ultrasound and x-ray programs at Cox College in Springfield, MO. My Key contributions to the project were:
Original idea for project (Canvas – med students), creation of surveys (questions and qualtrics form), needs analysis, assessment plan, formative evaluation, handouts, and learner analysis.
