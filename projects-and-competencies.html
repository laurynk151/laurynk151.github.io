    <h4> Learning Technologies Program Goals and Objectives</h4>
    <p id="paragraph1"> 


<p id="paragraph1">The LTD program prepares students to systematically design, develop, evaluate and lead learning technology and instructional solutions within schools, universities, corporations, and public and private organizations.

<p> Goal 1: Students will develop theory and research-based skills for innovative, aesthetic, accessible, equitable, effective and sustainable design and development of technologies for learning opportunities and systems. 
      <p> Objective 1.1: Students will design and develop learning and performance opportunities and systems including direct instruction, student-centered learning, collaborative work, and performance support.
        <br> Objective 1.2: Students will design and develop learning opportunities and systems for meaningful learning; promote student engagement in online learning environments; and select appropriate technology and learning objects to support learners. 
       <br>Objective 1.3: Students can conduct project management activities to support the total lifecycle of design, development and implementation of learning opportunities and systems.
      <br>Objective 1.4: Students will demonstrate mastery of technological production skills in web development, digital asset creation, and other applicable development skills necessary for the creation of learning systems, (e.g. web page prototyping, game design, digital media, etc.).
    <p><br>Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
        <br>Objective 2.1: Students can choose and conduct appropriate analytical methods and apply the results to the systematic design and development of learning environments and systems. 
        <br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).</p>
    <p><br>Goal 3: Students will understand the impact of technologies we create or use on society at large and strive to produce ethical, inclusive, and equitable instructional systems and technologies. 
       <br> Objective 3.1: Student will demonstrate ethical and inclusive practices to all aspects of analytical data collection and analysis methods used in the design and evaluation of instructional products or learning environments. (e.g., sampling methods) 
       <br> Objective 3.2: Students will design and implement instructional products and learning environments based upon Universal Design Principles.</p>
