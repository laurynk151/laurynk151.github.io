        <h3>Welcome to my about me page!</h3>
        <p>My name is Lauryn Kamler and I’m from Columbia, Missouri. I have a dog who is 16 years old. I like to knit and watch movies. I have worked in museums and archives. I studied in London for the summer in 2017. I visited museums and palaces. Paris and Hamburg were two other cities that I visited.<br/> <p>I graduated from MU in 2019. My Bachelor's degree is a <strong>Bachelor of Arts in History.</strong> I’m a new graduate student at MU. This course is the <em>first</em> class that I am taking for my degree. I’m pursuing a <strong>Master of Science in Learning Technologies and Design.</strong> I am also earning a certificate in User Experience and Usability. My goal is to become an Instructional Designer. I would like to work for hospitals or health systems. I want to help educate employees and patients since hospitals are confusing and scary for many people.</p>
