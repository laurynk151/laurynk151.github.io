    <h4><strong>IS_LT 9480: Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies</strong></h4>

            <p> <p id="paragraph1">This class is required for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. This internship is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue the UXU certificate.  </p>

            <p class="paragraph2">For this internship, I worked with the Design Services team in eLearning with Missouri Online. My advisor for the project was Dr. Joi Moore. I worked with Brad Mitchell, who is the Experience Design Manager for Missouri Online's Design Services team. The internship was completed during the Fall 2024 semester. With Brad, I helped to conduct usabiity testing regarding the Design Sprint micro-courses. This testing was completed by me, not in a group setting (Brad acted as Instructional Designer and interviewing participants). 
                Missouri Online is an online system that administers various online courses and programs to the four universities within the UM System. The services provided by Missouri Online allow for educational access to many students in Missouri and across the country. Missouri Online offers various services, including quality course reviews, training and certification, and design reviews. Among these services offered are various micro-courses that are known as Course Sprints. One type of Course Sprint is a Design Sprint. These Design Sprints introduce elements of visual design and online course building to faculty of any background, so long as they are in the UM system. 
            <p> <p id="paragraph3"> The usability study conducted for this paper aimed to assess the usability of the Visual Design Sprint for Missouri Online. The outcome goals for the Visual Design Sprint were to improve faculty understanding of visual design principles and to enhance the quality of online courses. This study was conducted as part of an internship course: IS_LT 9480. Before beginning the modules, participants completed a quiz of their knowledge of design elements and concepts that would be covered in the course. Next, the users went through and completed a series of modules about various visual design principles. The time commitment to complete these modules was around 1 hour. </p>
After completing the modules, the participant met with Brad Mitchell, the instructional designer for the project, who provided feedback and answered questions in a 30 minute meeting. During this meeting, the user went through a retrospective think-aloud of their experience. This meeting was recorded to collect data. Data was collected on user performance and attitudes regarding the usability of the course. Following the meeting, the participant created a redesign of a sample page. This redesign utilized principles learned in the course sprint modules. The participant submitted a screenshot of their redesigned page. At the conclusion of the study, users completed a paragraph about what they had learned and completed a questionnaire with likert scale questions. The usability elements focused on in this study included the user’s learnability, the efficiency of the course sprint, errors and user satisfaction. This project did not require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, as it was deemed a quality improvement project by the IRB. </p>

            <p> <p id="paragraph4"> Competencies: Front-End Analysis and System Evaluation (student) I developed critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems.
            <p>    Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. </p><br>
<p> Objective 2.1: Students can choose and conduct appropriate analytical methods and apply the results to the systematic design and development of learning environments and systems. </p><br>
<p> Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s). </p><br>
