            <p> <p id="paragraph1">This class is required for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. This internship is one of the main reasons I decided to pursue the UXU certificate. The internship will provide real world experience working in ID that I want to have by the time I graduate. I hope to either work with an office in the University of Missouri - possibly in the School of Medicine or MU Health Care. These entities work with diverse clientele with unique needs. I want to create projects that can be used in my portfolio that have also been used for real world applications. Access to the Information Experience Laboratory (IE Lab) was also another major reason I chose to pursue this certificate. I’m a local distance student, and having the ability to visit the lab in person will help me meet and make connections with others involved in Instructional Design. </p>

            <p class="paragraph2">A weakness for this internship will be time constraints as I work full time. However, I have the drive to work hard and succeed to get the most out of the internship. As I work full-time during the day, I would most likely need to complete the internship remotely. I would use my laptop to access zoom for meetings and programs such as Microsoft applications and any tools recommended or provided to me by the internship.
