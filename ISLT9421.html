    <h4><strong>IS_LT 9421: Usability of Information Systems and Services</strong></h4>
    <p id="paragraph1">This course is an introduction to “concepts and methods of usability testing and research and user-centered design strategy”. This course was taken as part of the Grad Certificate in User Experience and Usability. My goal with this course was to learn how to perform studies that research how to improve the usability of websites and applications. </p><br>
    <p class="paragraph2">This course was taken during the Spring 2024 semester with Dr. Noah Glaser. This was an incredibly interesting course, and I learned a lot about usability testing. The course covered topics such as heuristic evaluations, accessiblity, and usability as a concept and in practice. </p>
    <p>In ISLT 9421, we completed a series of group projects and usability tests. Under the instruction of Dr. Noah Glaser (Spring 2024 semester), I learned about various elements of usablity and usability testing. These included: usability evaluation methods, usability heuristics and evaluations, and mental models. During the semester, my group completed various projects and reports together. For the final project, our group completed a usability study evaluating the website Goodreads.com. I contributed to the usability testing, describing the technology/tool and its purpose, and the instruments for data collection and analysis section on the final report. In the report, we make reccomendations for improvement to the goodreads site based on user feedback from the usability tests.</p><br>
 
    <p id="paragraph1"> Goal 2: Students will learn to apply systematic methods for analyzing instructional or training needs, applying those results to instructional design and development, and collecting and analyzing formative and summative evaluation data to improve the instructional product. 
      <p><br>Objective 2.2: Students will design assessments aligned with the intended outcomes of the learning environments, choose and implement appropriate methods to conduct formative and summative evaluation of the learning environment, and use data to continuously improve the instructional product(s).
