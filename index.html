    <h3>Welcome to my website!</h3>
    <main>
        <p>This website will serve as a portfolio for courses that I plan to
    take in graduate school. I’m currently a student in the MS in Learning Technologies and Design
    program at Mizzou. I plan to grow and expand the portfolio as I move through the program. I
    hope to discuss the content that will be presented in three courses. I’ll discuss the learning goals
    that I hope to accomplish within each course. The three courses are: ISLT_9421 Usability of
    Information Systems and Services, IS_LT 9474 Front End Analysis of Systems, and IS_LT 9480:
    Internship in Information Science and Learning Technologies. These three courses are required
    for the Graduate Certificate in User Experience and Usability. I hope to earn this certificate along
    with my Master’s degree as it will provide a larger breadth of knowledge and increase my
    marketability for my goal career as an Instructional Designer.</p>
